% =======
Clumpiness of matter on small scales remains one of the most pressing questions in cosmology and galaxy formation (Bullock \& Boylan-Kolchin 2017).
In the $\Lambda$CDM model, clumps of dark matter with no baryons are expected to exist with masses as low as $10^{6}\rm\,M_\odot$ (Springel et al. 2008), while alternative models have a higher cut-off in the matter power spectrum (e.g., Bode et al. 2001, Hu et al. 2000).
Cold stellar streams --- remnants of disrupted globular clusters discovered in the Galactic halo (Grillmair \& Carlin 2016) --- are unique and powerful tools to study the properties of mass and dark matter within the Galaxy (e.g., Bonaca \& Hogg 2018).
For example, an encounter between a stellar stream and a dark matter subhalo perturbs the orderly structure of the stellar stream, produces density variations along the stream (e.g., Carlberg 2012), and, depending on geometry, possibly also folds a part of the stream (e.g., Yoon et al. 2011).
Signatures of such interactions in any of the known Milky Way stellar streams would provide critical tests of dark matter theories.
We propose to obtain high-resolution spectra to combine with kinematic data from the Gaia mission and thus map the full (6D) phase-space distribution of the GD-1 stellar stream, a nearby, dense stellar stream that shows possible signatures of subhalo perturbations.

{\bf GD-1 -- a halo stream with signatures of perturbation:}
The GD-1 stellar stream was discovered using photometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; Grillmair \& Dionatos 2006),
% and was later characterized using a combination of SDSS spectroscopic radial velocities and mean proper motions (Koposov et al. 2010).
% The stream appears to be on a retrograde orbit with respect to the Galactic disk, and, because of its relative proximity ($\sim 10~\textrm{kpc}$), appears as a significant over-density of old, metal-poor main-sequence turnoff stars.
and, in combination with handful of radial velocities for red giant star members, has been used to measure the mass and shape of the large-scale mass distribution within the Galaxy (Koposov et al. 2010; Bovy et al. 2016).
Using deeper photometry, de Boer at al. (2018) noted density variations along the stream and possible deviations of the main stream track that are not expected from simple models of the stream formation.
However, photometric studies alone suffer from significant contamination from background and foreground stars.
As an alternative approach to selecting likely GD-1 members, we mapped the stream additionally selecting members using the exquisite proper motions from the \textit{Gaia} mission (Figure~1, Price-Whelan \& Bonaca 2018).
This relatively contamination-free view of the stream reveals two significant gaps along the stream, one of which is associated with a spur of member stars parallel to the main stream, but offset from it by $\sim1^\circ$.
Such morphology can result from a stream interaction with a massive perturber (Figure~2).

% With this relatively contamination-free view of the stream and map of individual stream members, it is clear that (1) the stream extends at least $30^\circ$ beyond the previously seen end, and (2) that there is indeed interesting structure in the density distribution along the stream.
% In particular, ... under-densities... spur...blob...


% - discovered
% - density variations carlberg + later
% - Gaia and new era of stream kinematics, summarize our paper
% [Subhalo interactions with streams can leave gaps...Yoon, Erkal, etc.]

% - figure 1: map from paper, inset w transparent map, solid top priority -- getting most, typically 10 in dense Hectochelle fields, 5 in sparse, and expecting only a couple of Milky Way field contaminants

{\bf Hectochelle spectroscopy as the missing piece of the puzzle:}
Even after a selection based both on photometry and proper motions, some Milky Way contamination remains in the GD-1 sample (e.g., stars at $|\phi_2|>2^\circ$ in Figure~1).
We propose obtaining Hectochelle spectroscopy of likely GD-1 members to further confirm their common origin.
These data will provide radial velocities, and distance estimates more accurate than the available parallaxes, thus completely mapping the phase space distribution of the debris.
We plan to survey the highly non-uniform region of the stream, focusing in particular on the gap in the stream and the spur beyond the stream.
Simulations of stream perturbations predict unique signatures in the 3D kinematic structure of the debris (e.g., Figure~2, see also Erkal \& Belokurov 2015), so the proposed data will be able to rule on the interaction origin of features observed in the GD-1 stream and provide a critical test of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

% [But, other things can cause gaps too (epicyclic over-densities, progenitor disruption)]
% - in the interaction scenario (Figure~2), we expect velocity offsets between the stream and the spur, corresponding to an energy imparted by the perturber, and potentially constraining its mass.
% [Need 3D pos and vel to study velocity distribution along stream / energy offsets to know for sure]

% Radial velocities of the stream members are crucial for accurate gravitational potential recovery (Figure~2).
% Here \textbf{we propose to measure radial velocities for 150 stars along the NGC~5466 and Styx streams with MMT/Hectochelle}.
% The Hectochelle field-of-view is well matched to the streams' widths, and its sensitivity allows efficient mapping of the entire streams.
% Combined with the data already at hand for Pal~5 and GD-1 streams, using these new measurements within our modeling framework will provide significantly improved constraints on the distribution of dark matter within 50~kpc.

\section*{Experimental Design}\vskip-0.2in

% Describe the proposed observations and the targets.

\noindent{\bf Observing Strategy:}
We will use MMT/Hectochelle spectrograph to measure radial velocities of stars in the GD-1 stream.
- high probability members based on cmd + pm -- observe \emph{all} of them
- pilot data obtained in one field, high success rate
% Both streams are photometrically detected in the SDSS, which we will use for spectroscopic targeting.
% Streams occupy a well defined region in the color-magnitude diagram (Figure~3, NGC~5466 on the left, and Styx in the middle), so target priorities will be assigned through matched filtering to reduce the contamination from the Milky Way field stars.
% We aim to identify $\sim150$ stream members, as our preliminary modeling shows that such a number of radial velocity measurements is sufficient to place accurate and tight constraints on the Galactic gravitational potential.
% This will also be comparable to the number of radial velocity measurements for Pal~5 and GD-1 streams.
% However, since the targeted streams are much more tenuous than either Pal~5 or GD-1 (Grillmair \& Johnson 2006), we require more pointings for a given limiting magnitude to identify the same number of members.
% These observations will break new ground in exploring kinematics of diffuse halo substructure, and will also guide our future campaigns aimed at kinematic profiling of all the cold streams in the Milky Way.

\noindent{\bf MMT/Hectochelle Spectroscopy:}
We will observe with MMT/Hectochelle using the 110\,$l$/mm grating and the `RV31' order-blocking filter over the wavelength range 5150--5300\,\AA, yielding $\sim$1.5~km\,s$^{-1}$ per resolution element.
The velocity precision achieved by the TDC Hectochelle pipeline and this setup under typical observing conditions is further improved to better than 1\,km/s.
The chosen wavelength region contains the Mgb triplet and an assortment of Fe~II lines, which will be used to measure chemical abundances with the Payne code (Ting et al. 2018).
We will assign membership probability of each target based on the Gaia proper motions, PanSTARRS photometry, measured radial velocity and metallicity.
Target selection based on proper motions is highly efficient, so there are on average only x top priority targets per Hectochelle field.
We plan to dedicate additional y fibers to lower priority giant stars with similar proper motions, and z fibers to field halo stars (selected to have small parallax) in order to complement the H3 survey (PI Conroy) at fainter magnitudes.
The remaining $\sim$40 fibers will be used to estimate sky background throughout the field.

\noindent{\bf Proposal Time Request:}
To map the entire region of GD-1 with signatures of a potential perturbation, we require 13 Hectochelle pointings; x along the gap, y along the spur matched by y along the stream (Figure~).
Previous experience suggests that we can reach our targeted velocity uncertainty of $\lesssim$1 km/s in 2.5 hours for stars as faint as $g=20.5$.
Including overheads for field acquisition and calibration ($\sim$30 minutes per pointing), completing the observations of the planned 13 fields will therefore require $\sim$39 hours, or 4 nights.

{\par\bf R.A. range of principal targets (hours): }10 to 10:30
{\par\bf Dec. range of principal targets (degrees): }+35 to +45

Inset shows the region with the unusual morphology of an underdensity along the stream (gap) and an overdensity of GD-1-like stars beyond the main stream (spur).
{\bf Proposed observations will result in the complete 6D phase-space coordinates for almost all of the likely GD-1 members}, and thus illuminate the peculiar nature of the stream itself.
% Stellar density map of the Milky Way halo, obtained by matched-filtering the SDSS photometric catalog, reveals a wealth of substructure (modified from Grillmair \& Carlin 2016).
% Previous follow-up campaigns have spectroscopically characterized more extended features, such as the Sagittarius stream or the Virgo Overdensity.
% However, the underlying gravitational potential is most exquisitely traced by the cold and narrow streams, and its accurate reconstruction requires dynamical information.
% {\bf We propose to measure radial velocities along the NGC~5466 tidal tails and the Styx stream, thus doubling the census of cold streams with kinematic constraints, and validating current constraints on the Galactic gravitational potential}.
