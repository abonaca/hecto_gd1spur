Three-dimensional kinematics of the GD-1 stellar stream

Using recent Gaia proper motions, we produced the cleanest map of the GD-1 stellar stream, and identified likely stream stars that spur off ~1 deg from the main stream. If confirmed to be GD-1 members, these stars indicate a potential interaction of the stream with a low-mass dark matter subhalo. We request 4 nights of Hectochelle spectroscopy to map GD-1 stream in the spur region. The proposed data will definitively rule on the association of the spur with the main stream. Further, in perturbation scenario, three-dimensional velocity difference between the stream and the spur measures the perturber's mass.
